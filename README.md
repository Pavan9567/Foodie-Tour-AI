# FoodieTourGenerator

## Overview

FoodieTourGenerator is a Python-based project that leverages the Julep AI platform to create a one-day foodie tour for any list of cities. The workflow considers current weather conditions to suggest indoor or outdoor dining, identifies three iconic dishes per city, finds top-rated restaurants serving those dishes using web search (via Brave integration), and craft a delightful narrative for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This project is designed to be flexible, allowing users to input any cities they wish to explore.
